This PHP-Script is build to manage user-lists that're used in a http-basic-authentication process.
The authentication for this script itself is done using this user-list. Therefore you have to relogin if you're
changing your password.
It's a usual php-script. There's no need to add an .htaccess file or some special configuration.

If you're using Apache and run php as FastCGI-module you may also run into this issue:

You just need to copy the file config.template.php to config.php - that's all.
Now the file htusers will be used as user-list. It contains only one user called "admin" whose password is "admin".

Feel free to use and modify the script. Please provide your improvements as forge of this repository.

TODO:
* Implement sha1 password-encryption compatible to the apache-implementation: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.1/misc/password_encryptions.html
* Create, edit and delete users as admin
